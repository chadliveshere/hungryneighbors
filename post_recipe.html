                <p>I needed a cookie and I needed it bad.  I was fumbling through my cupboards for basic cookie ingredients (flour, sugar, vanilla extract, etc) when I noticed a container of peanut butter powder that I had purchased a while back at the grocery store.  I had been looking for normal peanut butter and became incredibly intrigued by this instant, powdered, version sitting on the same shelf boasting to have 90% less fat that the normal stuff.  I had tried using it for a peanut butter sandwich and found it too cumbersome and complicated so I hadn’t touched it since.</p>
                <p>Cookies, on the other hand, might be the perfect use for this powdery anomaly of nature. So I grabbed it and proceeded to mix up a batch of chocolate chip, peanut buttery goodness.  These have now become everyones favorite baked good of mine which they lovingly refer to as ‘crack cookies’.  I hope you enjoy them as much as everyone else does!</p>

              <ol>
                <li>In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda and salt; Set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large mixer bowl, cream together the slightly cooled melted butter, the sugars & the powdered peanut butter until light and fluffy (about 5 minutes). Beat in the eggs, yolks and vanilla until smooth.</li>
                <li>Mix in the flour mixture until just combined and then stir in the all the peanut butter & chocolate chips. Place the dough into the fridge to chill for about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350º. Line several baking sheets with parchment paper. When the 30 minutes are up, scoop out the dough onto the baking sheet with a medium scoop. Bake for about 8-10 minutes, until the cookies are just barely golden brown around the edges*.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>*The secret to perfectly moist and chewy cookies, under-bake them. If you pull them out and think they’re too soft, they’re probably done.  Pull them out, leave them on the pan for another 5 minutes and then transfer them to a wire rack to cool off.  You’ll have perfect cookies every time!</p>

                <p>I have never tried the buttermilk soaked bread but love the idea and plan to try this in the next few days. I usually bake my meatballs in the oven. Do you think this makes them drier?</p>

                    <p>It all depends in how you are making them in the oven. The buttermilk bread will definitely help to lock in most of that moisture. I’ve roasted them in the oven many times before and they turned out amazing. I do have this recipe that I haven’t tried yet that actually uses powdered gelatin in the meatballs to keep them moist and juicy while they bake in the oven. I’ll email it to you so you can have a play with it too.</p>
